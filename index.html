            <p>Research from organisations such as United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and Intergovernmental Panel
                on Climate Change (IPCC) provide provide substantial proof that climate change is a reality in Cambodia.
        
                This is proved by several pieces of evidence; temperature increase, change in rainfall pattern, extreme
                weather events, rising sea levels and impacts upon ecosystem and biodiversity</p>

        <div class="box"><img src="images/cause.png"> </div>
        <div class="content2">
            <p>One of the key reasons to Cambodias Climate Change is due to deforestation, driven by various factors,
                including illegal logging, agricultural expansion, and infrastructure development.
        
                1990 Cambodia had a 62.3% forest-land coverage. As of 2020, the number has dropped to 45.7%. Within the span
                of 30 years, forest-land coverage has declined by nearly 20%</p>

        <div class="content3">
            <p>Excess greenhouse gas emissions threatens biodiversity, disrupts ecosystems, affects indigenous communities
                and extreme weather conditions such as frequent and severe floods, prolonged droughts, and stronger storms.
        
                As Cambodia is economically heavily dependent on climate-sensitive sectors such as agriculture, forestry,
                resources and fishery, it has lead to 43% of communes highly vulnerable to the disasters and even poverty.</p>

        <div class="content4">
            <p>There are several solutions which you can do to help out the kingdom. One thing you can do is use
                eco-friendly transportations. For example, ride a bike or walk to school instead of always taking Tuktuks,
                or even carpool with someone to school. You can plant trees or create community gardens around your homes
                and even use organic herbs and fertiliser to help growth.
        
                Cambodia needs your effort to help fight against climate change.
